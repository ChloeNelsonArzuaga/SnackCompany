# Smart-Sweet Popcorn — Landing (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a minimal Vite + React project that implements a premium landing page for "Smart-Sweet Popcorn".

Why this layout

- Tailwind provides a fast, consistent styling system.
- Lucide-React is used for crisp SVG icons.
- The color palette uses Deep Cacao, Matcha Green, Salted Caramel, and Cinnamon Orange.

Quick start

From the `site/` folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the dev URL shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes

- This project uses the Tailwind CDN during development (via PostCSS) and requires `tailwindcss` installed as a dev dependency.
- If you want, I can run `npm install` here and start the dev server to verify everything locally.
